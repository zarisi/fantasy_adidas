# Fantasy adidas

This is a project created for the tecnical test for Adidas

It consist in a basic app made with React + Redux tath works like a basic version of a fantasy team where you select some players tath are retrieved from an API and you add then it adds them to your team.

# Next steps

* **Implement a toast system to show teh errors to the user**
    
    At the moment the errors are only shown on the browser console, but it should be shown with a notification in the form of a toast in one of the corners of the view

* **Improve even further the component tests**

    At the moment the component tests only cover the basic functionality of them but it should also cover all the edge cases tath a user can create when they interact with the app

* **Add a submit part**

    At the moment the app only show the selected players but you cant do anything more with them, so the idea is to implement an action tath "saves" your team like a lock system for the weekly match were all the validation must be done.
